                <p class="speech">"Dr. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and pioneer of microfinance,
                    envisions a Bangladesh where poverty is eradicated through inclusive economic growth and social
                    innovation. In his ideal future, every citizen has access to opportunities that empower them to
                    become self-reliant and contribute to a thriving society. Dr. Yunus advocates for a shift
                    towards social business models, where profits are reinvested into the community to address
                    critical issues such as healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. He believes
                    that harnessing the entrepreneurial spirit of the Bangladeshi people, especially women and
                    marginalized groups, will lead to a more equitable and prosperous nation. By fostering
                    innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to social justice, Dr. Yunus envisions a Bangladesh
                    that is not only economically strong but also a model for sustainable development worldwide."
